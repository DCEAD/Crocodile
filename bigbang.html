    <h1>Big Bang Theory</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMChxjg6MPHUGGcCparx7b.jpg">
    <p>
      The Big Bang is what birthed the Universe today. The Big Bang was a theory created by cosmologist during the early 1900s. The modernized theory of the Big Bang is that every matter originated from the same source. Although cosmologists have an idea of how the Universe started, they do not know what the Universe look like before the Big Bang. The biggest thing that made the Big Bang Theory believable is the multiple evidence floating around in space and the planet itself. Another evidence which proves that the Big Bang happened and that it is expanding are the blue and red shift. Because the Big Bang is the beginning of the Universe, cosmologists have questioned when does the Universe stop and what happens if it did. The Big Bang has brought many cosmologists excitement in studying and questioning what will happen next, which is why there much research done on it.

      The Big Bang is the explanation given by scientists of how the Universe was created. The idea of the Big Bang first appeared in “1931” by “Belgian cosmologist, George Lemaitre” [1]. In “1927”, Lemaitre had made a report about the expansion of the Universe but was ignored because was derived from another paper [1]. It was by “1930”, that other cosmologist “had concluded that the static models of the Universe…were unsatisfactory…the distant galaxies all appeared to be receding from us at speeds proportional to their distances” [1]. A year later, Lemaitre was able to “explore the consequences of an expanding Universe and boldly proposed” that it had “originated at a finite point in time” [1]. Although Lemaitre was the father of Big Bang, he had turned his head for other astronomical research while other cosmologists continue to build the theory of the Big Bang. The Big Bang may be the start of the Universe, but the research did not end there.

      The Big Bang Theory has been modernized to state that all matters of the Universe have originated from the same place. Since the first theory about the origination of the Universe “scientist, astronomers, and cosmologists” alike have finally concluded that the Universe was first “created in a massive explosion” [2]. This said explosion not only create the matters which can be found in space but also the “physical laws” and “ever-expanding cosmos” [2]. This massive explosion is known as the “Big Bang Theory”. The Big Bang Theory hypothesized that the matter floating around in space all came from one place “roughly 13.8 billion years ago” [2]. Although we may proof that all matters of the Universe came from the same place caused by the Big Bang, we still do not know what the Universe was like before the Big Bang. Now that the theory had modernized, we have a clear research and understanding of what the Big Bang really is.

      Although cosmologist have proven that the Big Bang had created the Universe, but they cannot prove what the Universe was like before the Big Bang started. Cosmologist had to make an “estimation” of when the Big Bang started about one minute before it happened [3]. Cosmologists used a model called the “Lambda-CDM Concordance model” which can be used described the evolution of the Universe [3].  Although cosmologist have estimated the date of the Big Bang when it started, that one minute does not give us a clear explanation of what initiated the Big Bang or what the Universe was like before the Big Bang started. The method that those cosmologist had used was somewhat helpful, but those cosmologist do not have all the rules to answer their question. we do not have a clear view of what the Universe was like before the Big Bang, but we do know that the atmosphere was hot before the explosion happened. So much research is done on the Big Bang theory, but there is barely anything that cosmologist can do to study farther than that one minute.

      The Big Bang Theory would not be believable if it were not for the many evidence floating in space and in the planet itself. When the Universe was created, the Universe also created other things with it. Aside from the various planets and stars in the Universe, there are five other things which can be found in space. The first is the microwave radiation. The “Cosmic Microwave Background or CMB” are radiations that are spread out throughout the Universe [4]. These radiations are “invisible” to our eyes, but they can be seen with special devices [4]. Cosmologists have stated that CMBs are the “earliest radiation that can be detected” from the Big Bang [4]. This radiation is also what helped cosmologist to figure out when the Big Bang started and partially what the Universe was like before the Big Bang.

      Hydrogen was also an element created after the Big Bang. When cosmologists were measuring the different “elements” which can be found in the Universe, they found that the “Universe contains about 74% hydrogen and 26% helium by mass” [5]. Cosmologists shown “these abundances” which could have only been made when the Universe was “a very hot, dense state… then when it quickly cooled and expanded” [5]. This means that the two lightest elements which makes up most of the Universe were created just when the Big Bang happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also found that when the Big Bang happened, the temperature from the Universe has dropped. A team from “Sweden, France, Germany, and Australia” used the “CSIRO Australia Telescope Compact Array” to measure the warmth of the Universe when it “was half its current age” [6]. The scientists claimed to investigate the history of the Universe they had to look “half-way across the Universe” [6]. The group were able to get a hold of the gas’s temperature and found it be “5.08 Kelvin” which is “extremely cold, but still warmer than today’s Universe” which is “2.73 Kelvin” [6]. This proof shows that the Universe as it expands farther away the colder the area left behind gets colder.

      Cosmologists have found that when the Big Bang happened not only were matters were created, but there were also antimatters created from there as well. Antimatters are “particles” that share the same mass as matters, but quality wise are completely different [7]. Antimatters are “positively charged positrons” [7]. Matter and antimatter are always created in a pair, but “if they come into contact” they will eliminate each other [7]. Cosmologists have stated that the first few seconds of the Big Bang, “the hot and dense Universe” had particles and antiparticles alike “popping in and out of existence” [7]. Although there are some matters and antimatters left over from the Big Bang, there are only very little antimatters left over.

      Lastly, cosmologists have found that the Big Bang also created the four fundamental forces. We have four forces in the universe which we call the “Fundamental Forces”. These forces can be seen not only in space but also on Earth as well, they act as the “physical forces” all around us [8]. The weakest but well-known force is gravity. Gravity is the force which can attract two or more objects “that have mass or energy” whether its seen or not [8]. Although it can pull planets around each, it is the weakest of all the other forces “Especially at the molecular and atomic scales” [8]. Although gravity had pull other objects including us, it has almost no effect on the other forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weak force also known as weak nuclear force is another fundamental force. The weak force is third to gravity. The weak force is “responsible for the particle decay” which is when one “subatomic particle” changes into another [8]. The interactions through this force can be described as a “bosons” [8]. The weak force has two different bosons: the “W and Z bosons” [8]. A weak force happens in the sun daily as the He (Helium) atom breaks down into two H (Hydrogen) atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lorentz force also known as the electromagnetic force. The electromagnetic force is the second to the strongest of all the fundamental forces. The electromagnetic force can be seen between the acts of charged particles such as “negatively charged electrons and positively charge protons” [8]. With particles such as these the opposites will repel each other, but if they are the same charge they will immediately stuck together. Although its stronger than gravity, it can be felt from any amount of distance like gravity. We ourselves if we touch another person or a hard surface what we are feeling is not the object themselves, we can feel the electromagnetic force repelling each other. This means we are not actually “touching” anything, but we can feel the object repelling us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last and strongest force is the strong force also known as the strong nuclear force. The strong force can combine the “particles of matter together to form a larger particle” [8]. This force itself makes the protons and neutrons. It can also keep the “atom’s nucleus” together [8]. Like the weak force, the strong force must work in close approximation of each other to really bond together. All these things which can be found in the Universe are evidence which proves that the Big Bang was a real event. Not only does the Big Bang theory have so much research on it, the things surrounding it also has so much research for better understanding on the subject.

      The red and blue shift are measurements of light wavelength in space. The red and blue shift can “describe how the light shifts” into a longer or shorter wavelength when an “object in space moves closer or father away” [9]. Since the light also expands in wavelengths, this means the wavelength can “stretch or crunch together depending on the relative position of the object” [9]. Although the wavelength of the blue and red shift may change as it travels, it is still a useful tool to use when measuring how far the universe has expanded. Although the red and blue shift is a great tool to use, what does it have to do with the Big Bang? The Blue shift shows evidence of the Universe contracting while the red shift shows the expansion. This observation is what “gave rise to the Big Bang Theory” [10]. The red and blue shift is the start of the Big Bang Theory and yet it brought so much research.
    </p>
    <p>
      While studying the expansion of the Universe, cosmologist would also question would the Universe ever stop expanding and if it did what would happen? Since the cosmologist created the Big Bang Theory, they kept calculation on the expansion of the universe. It is shown that the ring which is still expanding is still very fast and has not slowed down, probably because of the Big Bang explosion. But at some point an explosion must end, which brings the question what happens if it stops. This is what cosmologist call the Big Crunch Theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Crunch Theory is another idea brought by cosmologists. The Big Crunch Theory is a prediction to the question if the Universe finally stopped expanding what will happen? Cosmologist concluded that once the Universe stopped expanding that a huge wave will come flooding back towards where the Big Bang started sucking in on itself like a vacuum until everything is gone. From their calculation of the Universe expansion, they have confirmed that the expansion “seems to be accelerating” [11], meaning that the expansion is not stopping anytime soon. Although the Universe is still expanding and is not coming to a stop anytime soon, it is still a real possibility that the Big Crunch might happen when we least expect it. There is not much research about the Big Crunch Theory, mainly because it has not happened yet, but it does not make it any less important as the Big Bang Theory. 
    </p>

      The Big Bang has brought many cosmologists excitement in studying and questioning what will happen next, which is why there much research done on it. Since we figured out that Universe was born because of the Big Bang, more questions were brought by cosmologists since 1900s to present day. Although such much research and measurement were done on the Big Bang, we even have evidence of the Big Bang existing, but we have not and probably never will understand how it was initiated. Although we are doing a lot of research on how the Universe came to be, we may have to worry about the future such as the Big Crush. There is a lot of research done on the Big Bang and everything around it, but we might not ever get enough to truly understand how it happened.
